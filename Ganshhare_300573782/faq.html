		  <p> The packaging are to be put into a wheelie bin as products come in a cardboard 
              box. When recycling the packages should be flatted and put 
		      loosely into the bin. The cardborad boxes can also be used to place other items if the giftee
			  does not what to throw the cardboard box away. The plastic that holds the products are recyclable and should 
              be put in the wheelie bin as well. </p>
